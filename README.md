# Merin: DIY - Remote control car running on Arduino
Radio control cars are small vehicles powered by electric or gas motors that can be remotely controlled by a transmitter. The transmitter sends signals to a receiver on the car, allowing the operator to control the car's speed, direction, and steering. Radio control cars are available in a variety of sizes, from miniature models that can fit in the palm of your hand to large off-road vehicles that can climb over rough terrain.  

They are often sold with predefined chips and built-in software. Due to limited circuitry and insufficient documentation, enhancing or modifying existing RC cars can become a challenging task. The primary objective of our project is to overcome these obstacles and create a completely customizable RC car that can be fully controlled. In addition, it will be a perfect pair for our AirControl joystick. The name given to the project is Merin.
